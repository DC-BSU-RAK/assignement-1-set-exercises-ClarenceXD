    <p class="imagetext">A Cheesecake Graham Crust is a sweet, buttery, <br>
        and crunchy base layer for cheesecakes and other desserts. <br>
        It is typically made from crushed graham crackers, sugar, and melted butter,
        which are mixed together and pressed into the bottom of a springform pan or pie dish. </p>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>

    <h3>Graham Cracker crust</h3>

    <ol><li>Preheat oven to 325F (160C).</li><br>

    <li>Prepare Graham Cracker crust first by combining graham cracker crumbs, sugar, and brown sugar,<br> 
    and stirring well. Add melted butter and use a fork to combine ingredients well.<br>
    <em>1 ½ cups graham cracker crumbs,2 Tablespoons sugar,1 Tablespoon brown sugar,7 Tablespoons butter</em></li>

    <br><li>Pour crumbs into a 9” Springform pan and press firmly into the bottom and up the sides of your pan. Set aside.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Cheesecake</h3>

    <ol><pre>
    <li>In the bowl of a stand mixer or in a large bowl (using a hand mixer) 
    add cream cheese and stir until smooth and creamy (don’t over-beat or you’ll incorporate too much air). 
    <em>32 oz cream cheese²</em></li>

    <li>Add sugar and stir again until creamy.
    <em>1 cup sugar</em></li>

    <li>Add sour cream, vanilla extract, and salt, and stir until well-combined. 
    If using a stand mixer, make sure you pause periodically to scrape the sides and
    bottom of the bowl with a spatula so that all ingredients are evenly incorporated.
    <em>⅔ cups sour cream,1 ½ teaspoons vanilla extract,⅛ teaspoon salt</em></li>

    <li>With mixer on low speed, gradually add lightly beaten eggs, one at a time,
    stirring just until each egg is just incorporated. Once all eggs have been added,
    use a spatula to scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl again and
     make sure all ingredients are well combined.
    <em>4 large eggs</em></li></pre>

    <pre>
    <li>Pour cheesecake batter into prepared springform pan. 
    To insure against leaks, place pan on a cookie sheet that’s been lined with foil.</li>
    <li>Transfer to the center rack of your oven and bake on 325F (160C) 
    for 50-60 minutes (or longer as needed, see note 3). 
    Edges will likely have slightly puffed and may have just begun to turn 
    a light golden brown and the center should spring back to 
    the touch but will still be Jello-jiggly. 
    Don't over-bake or the texture will suffer, which means we all suffer.</li>

    <li>Remove from oven and allow to cool on top of the oven⁴ for 10 minutes.
    Once 10 minutes has passed, use a knife to gently loosen the crust from the inside
    of the springform pan (this will help prevent cracks as your cheesecake cools
    and shrinks). Do not remove the ring of the springform pan.</li>

    <li>Allow cheesecake to cool another 1-2 hours or until near room temperature
    before transferring to refrigerator and allowing to cool overnight or at least 6
    hours. I remove the ring of the springform pan just before serving then return
    it to the pan to store. Enjoy!</li>

    <h3>Notes</h3>

    <h4>Graham cracker crust</h4>
    <p>The crust is home made here is the <a href="">Instructions</a> (DOES NOT WORK)</p>

    <h4>Cream cheese</h4>
    <p>Make sure that you use the brick-style cream cheese, <br>
    not the spreadable version that is available in tubs.
    </p> 

    <h4>Bake time</h4>
    <pre>Bake time can vary depending on your oven, 
whether you bake your cheesecake on a baking pan or not, 
the color of your springform pan (light or dark), 
and even the precise temperature of your ingredients. 
Because of this I recommend checking your cheesecake at 50 minutes and adding time as needed. However, 
it is not uncommon for the cheesecake to take as long as 75 minutes to bake, but it's better to check sooner. 
    </pre>

    <h4>Cooling cheesecake</h4>
    <pre>I recommend the top of the oven because
it is usually the warmest place in my house (after it’s been on for over an hour). 
This will help to cool the cheesecake more gradually and will also help avoid cracks.
