<pre class="Bg-background">Dexter will never disappoint. Each and every episode is a work of art, and it never gets boring or old.
To start, we have excellent deliveries from Michael C. Hall as the serial killer (yet a like-able one)
known as Dexter Morgan. Add "The Excorcism Of Emily Rose" star Jennifer Carpenter, who plays
Dexter's sometimes moody sister, Deb.

It's a hard accomplishment to get someone to actually love a serial killer. But Dexter is one of those
few attempts that works. It's not forced upon you- the show doesn't shove the whole "well this serial
killer had a terrible childhood..." in your face. And it doesn't need to in order to get you to love its main
character. You just do.

<h3><p class="emoji">⭐10/10</p> One of the best shows of all-time</h3>

<pre class="Bg-background">Dexter is absolutely, without a doubt, one of the best shows ever created! It follows Miami PD blood
splatter expert Dexter Morgan (Michael C. Hall) as he both solves murders and commits them too. He
only murders bad people who've gotten away from the law. Being a blood expert he's able to
outmaneuver the police at every turn. It's a thrilling, one of a kind TV show that will keep you at the
edge of your seat throughout the entire series. Michael C. Hall is perfect as Dexter and the rest of the
supporting cast is just as fantastic! Yes, the ending was terrible but like Game of Thrones, Lost (or any
other show with a bad final episode), a few bad episodes at the end doesn't spoil what an overall great
show it was and that's what Dexter is...a GREAT show.

<pre class="Bg-background">Thanks to the quarantine, I watched series that I never imagined I would ever see, one of these series
Dexter, which I heard had a bad ending, so I decided not to watch it, what a nonsense I missed myself
watching one of the best series ever.

Dexter has eight seasons and a renewed new season to fix the poor ending and everyone's excited about it.
All seasons are excellent, from the first to the seventh, with the exception of the last.

You evaluate each season as follows.
First 9.7 Second 9.6 Third 8.7 Fourth 9.9 Fifth 9.0 The sixth 8.9 Seventh 9.0 The ex Final season 7.0 Waiting for the new season.
