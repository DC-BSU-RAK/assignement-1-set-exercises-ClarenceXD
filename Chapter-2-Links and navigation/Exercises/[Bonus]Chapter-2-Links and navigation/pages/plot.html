<h2>Dexter Plot</h2>

<pre>The series follows Dexter Morgan, a forensic technician specializing in blood spatter analysis for the Miami Metro Police Department, 
who leads a secret parallel life as a vigilante serial killer, hunting down murderers 
who have evaded justice due to corruption or legal technicalities. Dexter's adoptive father, Harry, 
trained him to channel his sociopathic tendencies into vigilantism, ensuring he only kills those who deserve it. 
The show aired from October 1, 2006, to September 22, 2013, on Showtime, and was based on the novel "Darkly Dreaming Dexter" by Jeff Lindsay.</pre>
